# Singapore-Flat-Resale-Price-Predictor

Tech Stack: Python | Pandas | Scikit-learn | Streamlit | Render

Overview:
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore based on historical data from HDB. The final solution is deployed as a web application using Streamlit, making it easy for users to input flat details and get price estimates instantly.

Key Features:

Data collected from Singapore Government Data Portal

Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering

Trained regression models to predict resale prices using flat attributes

Evaluated models using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² score for accuracy

Built a user-friendly web app to predict prices based on inputs like town, flat type, floor area, etc.

Deployed the application on Render for public access

Cleanly documented workflow from EDA to deployment

This project showcases practical skills in data wrangling, model building, and web deployment, with valuable applications in the real estate domain.
